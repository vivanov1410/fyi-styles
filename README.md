## Overview

FYi Patter Library is an boilerplate for web development projects at FYi doctors.

## Quickstart

Be sure to look over the [installation docs](docs/install.md) to verify your environment is prepared.
Check out the [commands](docs/commands.md) available to get started.

## Browser Support

At present, we officially aim to support the following browsers:

* IE9, IE10, IE11, IE Mobile 10
* FF 30, 31
* Chrome 34, 35
* Safari 7, 8
* Opera 23, 24
* iOS Safari 7, 8
* Opera Coast
* Android / Chrome 4.4, 4.4.3
* BlackBerry 10

This is not to say that FYi Pattern Library cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.

## FYi Pattern Library and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or other CSS libraries?

FYi Pattern Library doesn't aim to compete with CSS libraries like Bootstrap, Foundation and Pure. These libraries provide an excellent solution for prototyping your initial project. The biggest challenge they present is itâ€™s almost too easy to get stuck using their look and feel for the lifetime of your site. We think this leads to a poorer experience on the multi-screen web.

FYi Pattern Library provides boilerplate styles & a visual style guide for projects, but encourages customising these to fit your own site. This may need a little more work, but the reality is that any serious project is going to have its own look and feel. We want you to feel comfortable changing the kit to suit your own needs.

If you wish to use Bootstrap or other CSS libraries in your FYi Pattern Library project, you have the flexibility to do so.
